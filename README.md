### Exercise 

- Create a Mongoose database with 3 related models - Companies, Drivers, and Routes
- Each company should have a Name and a Headquarters Location, and own a number of Drivers
- Drivers need names, hourly wages, a boolean that says whether or not they are Class A Licenced, and own a number of Routes
- Routes need a starting and ending location, a distance in miles, an expected time needed, and a boolean of whether or not the route is complete and the package is delivered
- Create a Seed file to populate your database with at least 2 companies, 2 drivers for at least 2 companies, and 2 routes for at least 2 drivers
- Create a Query.js file that will update one of your routes from having the isDelivered variable to True for one of your routes
